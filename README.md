# Unsupervised Machine Learning Clustering of Market Cryptocurrencies
## Using PCA and k-means algorithm

## 1. OVERVIEW
Cryptocurrency data is given and a client is asking for the data to be grouped into classifications to further understand their investment value. The data is large and has many identifying characteristics for each Coin Name such as: Algorithm, IsTrading, ProofType, TotalCoinsMined and TotalCoinSupply. Using PCA to reduce the number of components to 3 and k-means we were able to cluster our cryptocurrencies into 4 different categories and place these into a tradable dataframe that was visualized using 3-D and 2-D Scatterplots.  

## 2. RESULTS

## 3. SUMMARY
- From what was taught in class an interactive webpage with public JSON data about earthquakes was able to be made. A user can adjust what information is displayed be it a different map or the severity of the earthquakes
- In order to use this repository to run the map, it must be downloaded and hosted as a local server on your computer 
- Additional Visualization Recommendations
  1) Allow a user to type in a range of what they would like displayed into an input box 
  2) Capabilities to increase the time range, would require a different data source
